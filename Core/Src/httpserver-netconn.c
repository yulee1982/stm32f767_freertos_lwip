/**
 * @file
 * HTTPD https example
 *
 * This file demonstrates how to initialize httpd for https.
 * To do this, it needs 2 files:
 * - server certificate
 * - server private key
 *
 * In addition to that, watch out for resource shortage. You'll need plenty of
 * heap (start with MEM_SIZE >= 200 KByte or monitor its err counters) and be
 * sure to at least set the following settings high enough (monitor
 * lwip_stats for an idea of what's needed):
 * - MEMP_NUM_TCP_PCB/MEMP_NUM_ALTCP_PCB
 * - MEMP_NUM_TCPIP_MSG_INPKT
 * - MEMP_NUM_TCP_SEG
